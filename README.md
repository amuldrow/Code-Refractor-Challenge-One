# Code-Refractor-Challenge-One

## Description 

This weeks challenge was an on the job ticket stlye challenge. The starter code was given to me to clone and create my own repository so that I could refactor and modify the existing code.This challenge was centered around accessibility and the company that "hired" me would like to make their website more accessible. This was achieved by changing / improving the codebase and the functionality of the website by insuring all links functioned properly.The order and overall organization of the source code was improved as well and alt attributes were added to every image link with understandable descriptions of the images shown. The title now says Horiseon Social Solution Services instead of just title so that users know what site they are on. Overall the site is now more accessible and effective aand easy to access by just about anyone.
